# Enefit - Predict Energy Behavior of Prosumers Kaggle competition
<br>
This repository contains a data science group project developed as a part of Introduction to Data Science course - LTAT.02.002 at University of Tartu 2023.

### The team
Group number - H9
<br>
1. Johhana Laane
2. Mattias Kimst

### Motivation and goal of the project
The project is based on Kaggle competition arranged by Enefit, a prominent energy company in the Baltic region dedicated to assisting customers in finding optimal green energy solutions. Currently Enefit is facing an imbalance problem, meaning it lacks accurate data on clientsâ€™ energy production and consumption. This leads to excess energy production, causing logistical and financial challenges. Therefore the goal of the project is to create a predictive model that can accurately forecast the energy behavior of prosumers. 

### Guide to the contents of the repository
All of code created during the project is stored in one notebook that is accessible from the link at the end of this readme. The notebook includes steps of preprocessing the data, feature engineering, splitting data into train and validation sets, cross-validation, training a LGBM model, plots for understanding the data and the performance of the model created. The notebook is commented in estonian.

H9_report.pdf includes report regarding business and data understanding.

The data used in the project was provided by organiser of the competition, Enefit. Due to the size of the data exceeding Github file size limits, the data files are not included in this repository. The data could be accessed at the competiton page https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/predict-energy-behavior-of-prosumers/data or from the link to the notebook below

### How it is possible to take the code and replicate the same analysis that the authors have done
